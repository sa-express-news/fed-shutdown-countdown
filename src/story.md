The U.S. government's shutdown entered its third day Monday, as partisan finger-pointing continued over legislators' failure to approve a budget amid a spat over immigration policy.

Republicans - who control both chambers of Congress and the White House - and Democrats - who are insisting on a plan for the hundreds of thousands of people brought to the country illegally as children - are pushing to foist the blame on the other side. Thousands of federal employees reported to work wondering whether they'll be furloughed.

Compromises between Democrats and President Donald Trump have seemed likely, only for the president or his advisers [to later insist that any deal to protect the so-called "Dreamers" must include stiff restrictions to the nation's immigration laws.](http://www.expressnews.com/news/us-world/article/Analysis-A-president-not-sure-of-what-he-wants-12513979.php).

Meanwhile, many in San Antonio's large military community will continue working, since federal shutdowns don't affect government employees deemed essential to national defense. But local leaders [worry furloughed civilian workers and contractors could ding the area's retail and restaurant industries.](http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/Texas-cities-eye-possible-government-shutdown-12505239.php)

And, of course, there are other costs.

Third-party economic forecasters estimated the 2013 government shutdown cost roughly $1.5 billion in lost productivity per day over 16 days, [according to a 2015 report from the Senate Joint Economic Committee.](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/c965246c-2f21-4d0d-a37a-9088f91470e4/jec-fact-sheet---the-economic-costs-of-a-government-shutdown---final.pdf)

We can use a little math to get a more detailed estimate.

With 24 hours in a day, the 2013 shutdown cost the U.S. economy about $62.5 million an hour. Or about $1,041,667 every minute. Or $17,361 every second.

Adjusted for inflation, that per-second total would work out to $18,325.74, according to [a calculator from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.](https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=17361&year1=201310&year2=201712)

With that number, we can put a price tag on some real or potential scenarios:

- When Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, [appeared in a five-minute interview with National Public Radio on Monday morning,](https://www.npr.org/2018/01/22/579645748/democrats-want-immigration-issues-solved-before-vote-on-budget) the economy lost about $5.5 million by the time he was done. 

- If Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, breaks up a tough negotiating session for a half-hour lunch, the U.S. economy will have lost almost $33 million in productivity by the time those talks resume.

- If President Donald Trump spent 30 seconds [retweeting himself attacking Democrats](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/955458357200130049) on Monday: $549,772.

“I’m not going to lie and tell you I’m happy with it,” William Armstrong, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1033 told Sig Christenson of the Express-News. “I’m disappointed in our legislators because, why are we even at this point? I haven’t heard them talking about not getting paid.”
